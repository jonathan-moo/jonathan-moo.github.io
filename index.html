						<h3>Snapshot Instructor Introduction</h3>
						<p>You can read some of my introduction at my website at: <a href="https://gefyra.co/about-jonathan-moo/">https://gefyra.co/about-jonathan-moo/</a>, 
							but I will give some short points on my career:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Worked in Paramount Global (formerly CBS Interactive) for 11 years:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Spent my first 5.5 years as a software/data engineer on analytics.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Adobe Analytics</li>
									<li>Google Analytics</li>
									<li>Baidu</li>
									<li>Google Adsense</li>
									<li>Embarked in several data projects that are too numerous to number.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Flew to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to continue my career in sports predictions and AI initiatives.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Delivered a Microsoft Golf Forecaster for USD 1.5 million, where I'm the only engineer working with a statistician.</li>
									<li>Delivered an Google Assistant voice app for NFL Fantasy recommendations for USD 1.75 million, where I was the lead engineer working on the voice recognition aspects of the project.</li>
									<li>Became a data engineering manager focusing on data science in CBS Sports, where I led a team to build sports prediction products and services.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							<li>Felt that I spent too much time in CBS Sports after 11 years in 2022, and I made the jump to PlayStation. Currently working in PlayStation as a data engineering manager for Partners.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Why these short notes?</h5>
						<p>A boot camp focuses on doing to learn. However, students did mention that they are doing the work and assignments, but they aren't understanding totally.</p>
						<p>The objective is to give enough contextual knowledge so that students can understand, and that your learnings stick with you as you progress in your career.</p>
					
						<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
						<p>These short notes is not part of the official curriculum. I'm doing this for the class.</p>

						<h3>Introduction To Data</h3>

						<h5>Why is data analytics such a hot skill these days?</h5>

						<div id="1-1-toggle" style="display: none;">
							<p>
								In most cases, many companies aren’t suffering from the lack of data. 
								They suffer from the lack of ability to extract value from the data they have. 
							</p>
							<p>Unused data is an expense.</p>
						</div>

						<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick='$("#1-1-toggle").toggle();'>Show/Hide Tips</button>

						<h5>What does the term 'data science' mean?</h5>
						<div id="1-2-toggle" style="display: none;">
							<p>
								Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for the outcome you’re trying to achieve towards:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Business</li>
								<li>Goals & Objectives</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick='$("#1-2-toggle").toggle();'>Show/Hide Tips</button>

						<h5>“Data science involves spreadsheets and formulas.”</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>In my line of work, we try to use as little spreadsheets and rely on databases instead.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>That’s because our work presents itself as a live service rather than pure analysis.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>However, spreadsheets can be useful for exploratory data analysis (EDA).</li>
							<ul>
								<li>We really want to do an EDA to understand the data, in order to:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Look for errors</li>
									<li>Identify trends and patterns within the data that would meet our business objectives and outcomes.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>The outcome is to mitigate risk before building because engineering efforts are expensive.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<h5>What is the difference between story telling and truth telling?</h5>
						<p>Personally, I believe that all story telling should be truth telling. 
							However, story telling is about relating descriptive statistics and data to the desired business outcome.</p>

						<p>Truth telling is more objective, where you’re gathering insights towards the story in which you have to build.
							<ul>
								<li>Especially in unsupervised learning. 
									Supposed you’re tasked to undercover the highest probability of a dengue fever outbreak over a city.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Dengue fever is a disease that is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. Very common in tropical areas.</li>
									<li>We don’t start off by knowing when a dengue fever happens. That would make us prophets instead. 
										Data scientists use data to validate their assumptions and observations.</li>
									<li>However, if there’s a person who reported sick with dengue fever, we know that mosquitoes generally travel about 320-330 feet in radius. The probability of a person getting sick with the same disease is much higher if he or she is within that radius, after attributing some margin of error.</li>
									<li>With more data coming in, we can increase our confidence over a certain spot or area of the city, and that’s where we can start to prescribe solutions to the outbreak.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>

						<h3>Course Overview</h3>
						<p>You're going to have 4 projects coming within your course:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Project 1</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Using Git and introduction to version-control</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I can’t emphasize enough how important this subject is in my line of work, and within the tech world. I will explain more when we get there.</li>
								</ul> <!-- Git end -->
								<li>EDA</li>
								<li>Installing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin</li>
							</ul> <!-- Project 1 end -->
							<li>Project 2</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) - Data Collection</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Before analyzing data, we have to collect the data. 
										The quality and volume of data severely impacts your analysis and applications, and thus we’ve got to get fundamentals right here.</li>
									<li>There are many other aspects of how to collect data, but you will be able to extrapolate your learnings to other applications as ETL is where we all started.</li>
								</ul> <!-- ETL end -->
							</ul><!-- Project 2 end -->
							<li>Project 3</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Data Visualization</li>
								<li>Data Ethics</li>
								<ul>
									<li>If you work for a multinational corporation (MNC), you will need to know enough to navigate so that your solution doesn’t end up becoming a lawsuit.</li>
									<li>Particularly in Europe (EU), this topic is highly sensitive. If the business has EU operations, this topic is not something you can skip over.</li>
								</ul> <!-- Data Ethics end -->
							</ul> <!-- Project 3 end -->
							<li>Project 4</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Machine Learning (ML) Integration</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Find a problem you want to solve, analyze and visualize.</li>
									<li>Use ML to solve.</li>
								</ul> <!-- ML integration end -->

						<h3>Past Learnings</h3>
						<p>Having taught in the University of Miami before, let me share some learnings that could help you out.</p>

						<h5>The boot camp feels like a sprint, but your career is a marathon.</h5>

						<p>This means pacing and consistency is more important than cramming it all in. Some tips to help you out:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Don’t beat yourself up if you don’t get it the first time round.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Sometimes taking a deep breathe, taking a walk or take a few days to digest could work wonders.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Example: When I had to deliver a USD 1.75 million project all by myself, when there are mental blocks, I take walks around the car park (when I’m at work), or go to the toilet cubicle and pray, and get my answer.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Good engineers don't always remember everything in code, but they at least know where to find their answers.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Don’t discourage yourself and find reasons to fail.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>I have had students ask me about my age. 
									They assumed I was much younger, and reasoned that I excelled in tech because of my age. 
									I’m not sure why but they reasoned that tech is for young people.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Turns out, I’m the same age as them.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>An expecting mother in my class finished her course before giving birth. 
									She had to juggle work, family and studies.</li>
								<li>I also had folks sharing their regrets to me after they stopped classes, when they see their classmates graduate. </li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<h5>Humility is the first requirement for success in this program.</h5>
						<p>I’m actually kind of surprised that the bootcamp emphasized this statement, which is very true.</p>
						<p>However, I will illustrate this with an example.</p>

						<h5>Coding is akin to your hands on raw ingredients.</h5>
						<p>If you want to be a chef, you have got to be good with your hands, your taste, your sense of smell, and your attention to detail.</p>

						<p>If you are looking at data-related work, all business intelligence tools have limitations. 
							At some point, how well you can manipulate data can be affected by coding skills.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Depends on the nature of your work.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There are data analysts that don’t code much as their scope is more on reporting.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<p>Cooking is a skill that everyone can pick up so long as they have a kitchen at home. However, there is a difference between cooking for a restaurant, versus cooking street food and cooking for yourself.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>What is the difference?</li>
							<li>How can you start cooking for a restaurant instead of cooking for yourself?</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Team work matters.</h5>
						<p>Picture this scenario: Your team has a multi-million dollar service that requires it to work during NFL Sunday.</p>
						<p>Are you going to work every Sunday to ensure that it works on Sundays? Or are you going to rely on your team mates?</p>
						<p>If you’re an entrepreneur, and you started off by doing everything yourself. Do you want to do everything by yourself for the rest of your career? What about your other passions in life?</p>
						<p>We are all social beings. School is where you can create these connections, and you’re encouraged to fail fast. Learn to work together in school.</p>
					
						<h5>Data is just like TV. It is not the box you’re looking at. It is the content behind the screen.</h5>
						<p>Similarly, there are many types of data, and they are better suited for certain industries.</p>
						<p>If you’re dealing with pure numbers, regression models work well.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Finance sectors</li>
							<li>Sports betting</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you’re dealing with visuals, classification models work better.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Labeling</li>
							<li>Maps</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It isn’t realistic to excel in every part of data from the start. The shorter road to success is to pick what you are good at and run with it. Or you can pick your passion.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you are already working in a certain industry, work on projects that relate to that industry.</li>
							<li>If you are looking for something new, pick the type of data from the start and work on such projects during the bootcamp.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Keep a record of your learnings in a repository of some sort.</h5>
						<p>Humans forget. Thus, we invented writing.</p>

						<h5>Last but not least, show instead of tell.</h5>
						<p>One of my students created a prototype dashboard that relates to the industry she wants to work in, and pitched it to her recruiters. She got a job pretty quick.</p>

					<div id="04-before-break" class="student-block">
						<h3>Before the Break</h3>
						<p>We really want folks to know each other better, and this can be a prelude to project work.</p>
						<p>If you need to confirm your software installations, use the break to do so.</p>
					</div> <!-- 04-before-break end -->

					<div id="05-break" class="student-block">
						<h3>Break for 15 minutes starting from 8:05pm</h3>
					</div> <!-- 05-break end -->

					<div id="06-group-great-debate" class="student-block">
						<h3>Group Activity: The Great Debate</h3>
						<h5>Which food do Americans prefer? Italian or Mexican food?</h5>
						<p>Not the greatest question ever because it lacks an obvious business outcome, but it’s an exaggeration to prove a point. </p>
						<p>Many times, binary classification is very important, and I will give you some examples:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Is this image family safe? Or no?</li>
							<li>Is the sports prediction accurate after the fact, or no?</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Analytics Paradigm</h5>
						<p>The team and business context can shift how this paradigm is going to work for you.</p>

						<p>Often, we use Agile principles and methodologies to run teams so that we produce regular and repeatable outputs, in order to move the work towards our business outcomes. It is by no means a waterfall formula.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>“Waterfall” means it flows from top to bottom, and it is usually inflexible.</li>
							<li>In agile, this process is going to be iterative and flexible.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>We use milestones as maturity indicators for a project, and the analytics paradigm fits into our milestones.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Agile is out of scope in terms of learning, but do remember to be flexible in how you use the analytics paradigm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>In many companies, if you’re a data analyst, data engineer, or a data scientist, you will work with a scrum master who will work with you to apply this analytics paradigm with agile principles. Thus, you don’t have to be overtly concerned with agile principles.</p>

						<h3>Group Activity: Predicting Gentrification</h3>
						<h5>What is `Gentrification`?</h5>
						<p>It is the process of changing the character of a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses.</p>
					</div> <!-- 07-group-gentrification -->
					
					<div id="08-homework-discussion" class="instructor-block">
						<h3>Homework Discussion</h3>
						<p>I’m not the person grading your assignments. There’s a team that does it.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>This promotes objectivity.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>What is the goal of the next homework?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To ensure you can manipulate data within Excel at will, and perform an EDA over the data set</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There are many ways or tools to use, but Excel is one of the “lowest barrier to entry” tools available in the market.</li>
								<li>Excel has a hard limit in terms of the volume of data it can take. If it goes above a million records, you can expect sluggish behavior from your local machine.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>That’s because your local machine has limits to the amount of memory and processing power. In data science, volume of data matters in terms of accuracy, and thus we use cloud computing regularly to analyze data.</li>
									<li>However, applying your EDA on a sample size that is statistically significant is very important to prove your logic, because engineering and computing is expensive. Excel can be very useful in this regard.</li>
								</ul>
