						<h3>Introduction</h3>

						<p>Fulfiling some backlog content. Was away in Amazon Re:MARS for a work conference when my TA taught during my absence.</p>

						<p>Re-visiting this subject for refresher.</p>

						<p>I won't be able to teach a whole course of statistics and math on this subject, and so if we dive too deep into these mathematical formulas, I would need to put a hard stop to continue the lesson.</p>

						<p>However, I have placed links and references for your further study on your own. Feel free to ask me during office hours.</p>

						<h3 id="objectives">Objectives For Lesson 22.1</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>Introduction To Machine Learning</li>
						</ul>

					</div>

					<div id="intro" class="instructor-block">
						<h3>Introduction To Machine Learning</h3>

						<p>Before we get started with machine learning, we need to understand some basic concepts and principles first.</p>

						<p>Machine learning isn't mystical. In my opinion, it's real-time statistics that is made possible on today's machinery.
							You will realize that many of the algorithms we have today are based on the foundations of statistical and mathematical discoveries in the past.
						</p>

						<p>In school, we had to learn about sampling. That's because it's not always possible to gather every piece of data necessary to predict. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Let's pretend you work in a company which makes condoms.</li>
							<li>You're a QA analyst who's required to assess the reliability of a product.</li>
							<li>To test your analysis, you can't possibly be stress-testing all the condoms in your inventory to test for reliability. You won't have anything left to sell!</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Sampling allows us to extrapolate a scenario, where probably 1 out of 10,000 products, there is one which is faulty. This is also foundational for predictive analytics.</p>

						<p>However, recent development of technology is coming to the point <strong>where we are relying less on sampling, and we have the machinery to ingest tons of data for analysis</strong>. Thus, this is the beginnings of data science and machine learning.</p>
					
						<h3>Basic Definitions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Intelligent Algorithms</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Algorithms which enhances itself based on the data given to make informed decisions.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Within <strong>Intelligent Algorithms,</strong> there are:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Machine Learning</li>
								<li>Predictive Analytics</li>
								<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
						<p>Agents that can perceive environments and make decisions to maximize its chance for achieving its goals.</p>

						<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Google DeepMind for StarCraft 2</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Predictive Analytics</h4>
						<p>Based on patterns and recurring behavior, we extrapolate the chance of the situation happening again, and we optimize our business objectives in relation to the data given.</p>
					
						<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Retargeting ads: If you're going to buy coffee from Amazon, it's likely that you're going to buy coffee again from Amazon. So we show you new coffee products on Amazon.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
						<p>There are different categories of machine learning as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Unsupervised learning: You observe the data to interpret itself, and let that dictate your parameters to obtain accuracy.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Clustering: Finding groups within a population</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Supervised learning: You already know the outcome you want, and so you determine the parameters for your data to boost accuracy.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Classification: Grouping data into buckets with similar properties</li>
								<li>Regression: Fitting data to determine if an event would happen again.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Reinforcement learning: It's more for AI systems, but the data which you output can feed itself into the model, and it enhances your existing accuracy to accomplish a goal.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>In machine learning, we always do the <strong>model-fit-predict</strong> model. You will see that often in your student activities.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Model</strong>: Finding the right algorithm and set of features from the data to determine the accuracy of your outcome.</li>
							<li><strong>Fit</strong>: Using what you have modeled, you're using data (usually historical data) to train the model in order to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy.</li>
							<li><strong>Predict</strong>: After training the model, we input raw data from the environment into it and it will determine the outcome based on the model.</li>
						</ul>

					<div id="01-Ins_Univariate_Linear_Regression_Sklearn" class="instructor-block">
						<h3>Linear Regression</h3>

						<p>Linear regression is the basic foundational block for other machine learning algorithm such as neural networks and deep learning.</p>

						<p>For example, in the activity, we have a function called <strong>make_regression</strong> from the sklearn.datasets library:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>sk-learn</strong> stands for <strong>scikit-learn</strong>. This is the Python library we'll be using for the majority of this course.</li>
							<li><strong>make_regression</strong> generates a random regression problem as an example:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>n_samples: Number of data points</li>
								<li>n_features: Number of data properties to train or predict from.</li>
								<li>random_state: An integer seed to replicate the example if needed.</li>
								<li>noise: Standard deviation applied to the output</li>
								<li>bias: computed value as the distance between the average prediction and true value.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<p>This diagram should help in defining bias:</p>
						<img src="img/bias_variance_illustration.png" class="img-fluid" >

						<ul>
							<li>Bullseye is the goal.</li>
							<li><strong>Bias</strong> strays the aiming of your bow.</li>
							<li><strong>Variance</strong> is the slight movements from your aim (your arms were tired) that results in hitting different spots around the same region.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>In the student activity, the <strong>bias</strong> value is arbituary, and it pushes the line to around 100 at y. If you put it at zero, it will be around zero at the y margin.</p>
						
						<p>This linear graph is to simulate a probable scenario. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We understand that the larger the house, the more expensive it is. (Let's ignore the other factors like traffic and environment.)</li>
							<li>As square feet increases, we expect the home price to escalate in a <strong>linear fashion</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>It is unlikely that the home price relates to square feet in a <strong>sine</strong> curve. That would mean that at certain square feets, it will mean lower prices as indicated by the <strong>sine</strong> curve.</li>
								<li>But a <strong>log</strong> curve is possible, since materials' price can sharply rise at a certain volume.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<p>You might be planning for an apartment, and you're looking at 1000 square feet. The linear line <strong>helps you to predict the price of the home</strong> based on other home prices indicated. That's how linear regression and basic machine learning works in general.</p>
					
						<h3>Mathematical Formula</h3>

						<p>It's going back to high school, but:</p>

						<code>y = mx + b</code>
						<ul>
							<li><code>y</code> is the output response</li>
							<li><code>x</code> is the input feature (we have one feature, remember? Square fit is the feature for our example.)</li>
							<li><code>b</code> is the y-axis intercept.</li>
							<li><code>m</code> is the gradient, or <strong>weight coefficient</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					
						<p>Get ready for high school math!</p>
					</div>

					<div id="02-Stu_LSD" class="student-block">
						<h3>02-Stu_LSD: Your Turn</h3>

						<p>In this activity, instead of using a random dataset from the <code>sklearn.make_regression</code> object, we're using a CSV file to generate plot points instead.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="03-Ins_Quantifying_Regression" class="instructor-block">
						<h3>Quantifying Regression</h3>

						<p>This just means how do we prove if our model works? How do we quantify accuracy?</p>

						<p>As we use linear regression as our foundational study material, realize that what you learned here is going to be applied to other models as well.</p>
					
						<p>To quantify accuracy, we use common scoring metrics such as:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>R-Squared (R<sup>2</sup>)</li>
							<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>What I'm going to teach you are some of the fundamentals of R<sup>2</sup> and MSE to understand how we derived accuracy, but to find out more on the mathematical derivation, look at the links below:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/bivariate-data-ap/assessing-fit-least-squares-regression/v/r-squared-or-coefficient-of-determination">R<sup>2</sup> or coefficient of determination</a></li>
							<li>MSE (I don't have a good math video tutorial at the moment, so you could suggest, and I'll put it up here.)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>R<sup>2</sup> Concept</h3>
						<p>We use the margin of errors to depict the accuracy of a model. Consider this graph:</p>

						<img src="img/r-squared-example-0.png" class="img-fluid" />

						<p>We're trying to measure the accuracy of our model by using the margin of errors. Thus:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Having the same input (x<sub>1</sub>), the predicted data would feature on the line, and we have the actual results as (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>).</li>
							<li>The margin of error, <code>r</code>, would be <code>y<sub>1</sub> - y</code> since there is a difference between the 2 output values.</li>
							<li>Squaring them eliminates negatives (high school math), and we get an area on the graph.</li>
							<li>We can't base our accuracy on a single margin of error. Thus, since all points have their margin of errors, we add them all up to get the <strong>Squared-Error of the line (SE<sub>line</sub>).</strong></li>
							<li>But the <code>SE<sub>line</sub></code> doesn't allow us to compare with anything. So, we calculate the <strong>total variation in <code>y</code></strong> to quantify how the margin of error against the total variance of y.</li>
							<li>By division, <code>SE<sub>line</sub>/SE<sub>y-mean</sub></code>, we get the amount of error in relation to the total variance of y. But this describes the error percentage. How about the accuracy?</li>
							<li>Accuracy is described by 100%, or 1 if we're dealing with decimals. Thus, <code>1 - SE<sub>line</sub>/SE<sub>y-mean</sub></code> will give us an accuracy score, and it's often described as <strong>the coefficient of determination</strong>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Beyond this will be out of our scope for math.</p>

						<h3>MSE Concept</h3>
						<p>Using the same concept for calculating margin of error for <code>r<sup>2</sup></code>, we simply sum the squared margin of error and divide it by the total number of points:</p>
						<img src="img/mse-example-0.png" class="img-fluid" />

						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><code>R<sup>2</sup></code> value should be as close to 1 for accuracy.</li>
							<li><code>MSE</code> score should be close to 0 for accuracy.</li>
						</ul>
